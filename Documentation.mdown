## Overview ##

Actions to scale, change the format of images. Both actions take an argument in Quicksilver's 3rd pane. Examples can be seen below.

## Actions ##

Scale Image…
  : This method allows you to scale an image selected in Quicksilver's 1st pane. Various scaling and format options are available, and are listed below.

Save Image in Format…
  : Saves the image in the format specified. Valid formats include:
  `tif`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`, `jpg` (or `jpeg`), `jpg2` (or `jpeg2`)

### Scaling Syntax ###

The basic format for the string is (terms in square brackets are optional):

    SCALING_INFORMATION [as FORMATTING_INFORMATION]

where `SCALING_INFORMATION` has the format: 

    [fit] WIDTH [x HEIGHT]

with `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` defined as whole numbers in terms of pixels. For example, "210" means "210px", but it is also possible to type "210px".

`FORMATTING_INFORMATION` has the format:

    JPG/PNG/GIF/TIFF [low/med/hi] [prog(ressive)] [inter(laced)]

which allows you to set the file type, quality of the image and various further options (progressive for `.jpg` files and interlaced for `.png` files).

Examples:

80%
  : Scales an image to 80% of the original image, keeping the same file format as the input image.

500px x 50px
  : Scales the image to be 500px in width by 50px in height. The format is kept the same as the original.

x200 as gif
  : Scales the image to be 200px in height, maintaining the width so as to scale the image. Saves the result as a GIF file.

fit 640x480 as jpg high progressive
  : Creates a JPEG image that will fit within a 640x480 rectangle and is of high quality with progressive enabled.

50% as interlaced png
  : Creates a PNG with dimensions half of the original.

## Trigger Events ##

Event Triggers can be run when images are resized or reformatted by this plug-in. For both actions, the "Event Trigger Object" will refer to the new image file(s).
